            Nutrients and health benefits
        </h2>
        Consuming dairy products provides health benefits â€“ especially improved bone health. Foods in the Dairy Group provide nutrients that are vital for health and maintenance of your body. These nutrients include calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein.

<h4>Nutrients</h4>

Calcium is used for building bones and teeth and in maintaining bone mass. Dairy products are the primary source of calcium in American diets. Diets that provide 3 cups or the equivalent of dairy products per day can improve bone mass.
Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Dairy products, especially yogurt, fluid milk, and soymilk (soy beverage), provide potassium.
Vitamin D functions in the body to maintain proper levels of calcium and phosphorous, thereby helping to build and maintain bones. Milk and soymilk (soy beverage) that are fortified with vitamin D are good sources of this nutrient.
 Other sources include vitamin D-fortified yogurt and vitamin D-fortified ready-to-eat breakfast cereals.
Milk products that are consumed in their low-fat or fat-free forms provide little or no solid fat.
 

<h4>Health benefits</h4>

Intake of dairy products that contain calcium is linked to improved bone health especially in children and adolescents, and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
The Dairy Group provides many nutrients to the diet including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A, vitamin D (in products fortified with vitamin D), riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein, potassium, zince, choline, magnesium, and selenium.
The intake of dairy products is especially important to bone health during childhood and adolescence, when bone mass is being built.

<h4>Why is it important to make fat-free or low-fat choices from the Dairy Group?</h4>
Choosing foods from the Dairy Group that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol can have health implications. Diets high in saturated fats raise "bad" cholesterol levels in the blood. The "bad" cholesterol is called LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. 
High LDL cholesterol, in turn, increases the risk for coronary heart disease.
Many cheeses, whole milk, and products made from them are high in saturated fat.
To help keep blood cholesterol levels healthy, limit the amount of these foods you eat. In addition, a high intake of fats makes it difficult to avoid consuming more calories than are needed.
