        <h2>1. Pork</h2>
        
        <p>Pork is one of the most popular forms of meat in the world.
        
        Despite some confusion on the issue, pork is classed as red meat. This is because it contains a large amount of myoglobin, a protein responsible for the red color of meat.
        
        In fact, there are so many different cuts of pork, and a variety of meat products use it such as;</p>
        
            <p>Bacon</p>
            <p>Ham</p>
            <p>Hot dogs</p>
            <p>Jamon</p>
            <p>Prosciutto</p>
            <p>Salami</p>
            <p>Sausages</p>
        
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            <p>Pork is a particularly significant source of thiamin (vitamin B1). The content of this important vitamin is much higher than in other meat and plays an essential role in glucose metabolism and protecting cardiac health (2, 3).
        
            Much cheaper than most other meats.
        
            Pork contains decent amounts of selenium and zinc, which are responsible for boosting the immune system, defending against oxidative stress, and optimal hormone production.</p>
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            <p>Pork is more susceptible to bacterial contamination and food-borne illnesses than other meat; ensuring pork is thoroughly cooked is essential.</p>
            </br>
        <h2>2. Beef</h2>        
        <p>When most people think of red meat, they probably imagine beef.
        
        There are many different beef products and cuts of beef, ranging from hamburgers to rib eye steaks.</p>
       <h4> Benefits</h4>
        
           <p> Beef contributes large amounts of iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 to the average person’s diet.
        
            Interestingly, the main fatty acid in beef is none other than oleic acid. If you haven’t heard of it before, then it’s also the main fat in olive oil (and known as “heart healthy”).
        
            Beef contains a wide variety of potentially beneficial compounds that include creatine, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and glutathione</p>
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            <p>Excessive beef consumption can increase circulating iron to unhealthy levels in some individuals. These high levels can increase the risk of various cancers and cardiovascular disease. This risk is especially the case in those with a genetic mutation called hemochromatosis, which causes over-absorption of heme iron (15, 16).
        
            Overcooking beef (burning) can lead to the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs). Both of these compounds are carcinogens, but we can minimize their risks by sensibly cooking meat.</p>
    
       <h2> 3. Lamb and Mutton</h2>
        
        <p>Both lamb and mutton are very similar types of meat, with one fundamental difference;
        
            Lamb is from a sheep less than one-year-old
            Mutton is the meat of an adult sheep</p>
        
               <h4> Benefits</h4>
        
       <p> Generally speaking, both lamb and mutton are nutritious meat options.
        
            Because sheep graze on pasture all day, the omega 6 to 3 ratio is very low—and perhaps optimal—compared to other meats (20).
        
            Lamb contains a broad range of health-protective nutrients, especially zinc, selenium and B vitamins.</p>       
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Lamb is very expensive in comparison to other kinds of meat.
        
        <h2>4. Chicken</h2>        
        <p>Alongside beef and pork, chicken is one of the ‘big three’ popularity-wise.
        
        However, chicken is a different classification of meat and comes under the poultry category.
        
        People commonly refer to poultry as ‘white meat’.</p>
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Chicken is very cheap and affordable.
        
            For those who are trying to consume less fat/calories, chicken offers a smaller amount than other meats but with the same protein content. In other words, chicken is protein-dense.
        
            Chicken stock/broth offers a significant source of gelatin. As chicken bones have a lower density than other meats, the collagen and gelatin are far easier to extract.
        
            Chicken provides a decent source of necessary vitamins and minerals, particularly selenium, potassium, phosphorus and B vitamins.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Unfortunately, bacterial contamination with strains such as E. coli and salmonella isn’t rare with chicken. As a result, strict hygiene procedures are necessary when handling raw meat (22, 23).
        
        
       <h2> 5. Turkey</h2>
        
        Turkey is another type of white meat, probably best known for its appearance at the Christmas table.
        
        It has both a deeper yet drier taste than chicken and is a less prevalent form of poultry.

        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Turkey is among the most protein-dense of all meats, offering 17.5 grams of protein for only 149 calories.
        
            Similar to chicken, turkey also provides a significant amount of B vitamins, potassium, selenium and phosphorus.
        
            Turkey provides an inexpensive source of high-quality protein.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Similar to other forms of poultry, turkey is more likely to harbor foodborne bacteria than red meat (25).
        
       <h2> 6. Venison</h2>
        
        Venison refers to the flesh of a deer, and it is a traditionally rarer type of meat.
        
        In recent years, sales of venison have been soaring as a result of its perceived healthy reputation among consumers.
        
       <h4> Benefits</h4>
        
            As deer mostly live and feed in the wild, venison has a much lower fat (and omega-6 to omega-3 ratio) than other meat. The excellent omega 6 to 3 ratio stands at approximately 2:1.
        
            Venison has more vitamins and minerals than beef despite having significantly fewer calories. In short, venison is possibly the most nutrient-dense meat out there.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            One obstacle could be the price; venison costs a lot. Expect to pay around $30 for one pound of venison steak.
        
            Source is extremely important. In some areas, deer can be infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD). See this full guide to venison meat for more information.
        
        <h2>7. Duck</h2>
        
        Duck is one of the less popular types of meat.
        
        However, it has immense popularity in Chinese populations, where ‘Peking duck’ is a showpiece dish.
        
        Like chicken and turkey, we can consider duck as a kind of white meat.
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Duck provides a significant amount of selenium, phosphorus, and B vitamins. These vitamins are all important for optimal energy production and a well-functioning immune system (28, 29).
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Making duck at home—or having a roast duck—is perfectly healthy. However, be aware that in Chinese cuisine, duck often comes in sauces made from a variety of additives including sugars and oils.
        
        <h2>8. Wild Boar</h2>
        
        Wild boar is a non-domesticated pig that lives in the wild.
        
        The meat of this animal is also known as ‘wild boar.’
        
        Generally speaking, wild boar contains a higher proportion of protein and a smaller amount of fat than regular pork.
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            As it lives and feeds in its natural environment, wild boar contains a higher proportion of omega-3 fatty acids than purely grain-fed pigs.
        
            Wild boar contains an array of health-protective nutrients, in particularly B vitamins, selenium, and zinc.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Trichinella spiralis, a parasite sometimes found in pigs, occasionally contaminates wild boar meat. There have been several outbreaks of this in recent years, but it is quite rare (31, 32, 33).
        
        <h2>9. Bison</h2>       
        <p>Bison is a type of red meat that is nutritious and very lean.
        
        For this reason, it is an excellent choice of meat for anyone looking to keep their fat or calorie intake a little lower.
        </p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Although the above data is for conventionally raised animals, grass-fed bison can be very high in omega-3.
        
            Bison offers a wide range of nutrients for very few calories.
        
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Bison is very expensive compared to other types of red meat, making it unaffordable for some people.
        
        <h2>10. Goose</h2>  
        Goose is a type of poultry that comes under the ‘white meat’ banner, and it is particularly popular throughout China, Europe, and the Middle East.
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Goose meat is a rich source of many nutrients, and it is particularly high in vitamin B6, phosphorus, and selenium.
        
            Similar to other poultry options, goose meat (without skin) is very protein-dense.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Depending on location, it can be difficult to find goose meat for sale.
        
            Sometimes wild geese can be susceptible to infections which can be transmittable to humans (by touch). However, this should not be an issue with goose meat bought from a store. Also, like with other poultry, cooking will kill any bacteria present (36).
        
        
        <h2>11. Rabbit</h2>        
        Although the idea of rabbit as food can seem strange, it is a common type of meat in some parts of Europe and the United States (and China).
        
        Rabbit is very popular in France where it is considered to be a delicacy.
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Rabbit is a substantial source of vitamin B12 and it is also very high in selenium.
        
            Although it is not as high in protein as some kinds of meat, rabbit is very low in fat and calories. As a result, it is very protein-dense; 20 grams of protein per 136 calories.
        
            Rabbit offers one of the better omega-6 to 3 ratios among meat.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            Wild rabbits are occasionally infected with a pathogen known as tularemia. It is possible for undercooked rabbit meat to transmit this infection (38).
        
        <h2>12. Pheasant</h2>
        
        Roast Pheasant Meat On a Plate.
        
        Pheasant is thought to be a ‘premium’ meat product thanks to its flavorful taste, and the meat is popular across Europe and the United States.
        
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        
            Pheasant is an excellent source of B vitamins, and it is particularly high in these nutritions compared to other varieties of poultry.
        
            Pheasant need space and they are usually wild or from ‘free range’ farms where they have access to pasture.
        
        <h4>Concerns</h4>
        
            There are no specific concerns about pheasant meat. However, like all poultry, it should be cooked fully to minimize the risk of food poisoning.
