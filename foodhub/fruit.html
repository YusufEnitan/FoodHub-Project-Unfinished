        Eating more fruit is an excellent way to improve overall health and reduce the risk of disease.

        Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids.
        
        Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person's risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. Citrus fruits and berries may be especially powerful for preventing disease.
        
        A 2014 studyTrusted Source ranked "powerhouse" fruit and vegetables by high nutrient density and low calories. Lemons came out top of the list, followed by strawberry, orange, lime, and pink and red grapefruit.
        
        In this article, we look at the nutrition and the many and varied health benefits of these and other fruits you can find in the supermarket.
        <h4>1. Lemons</h4>
        Lemons contain vitamin C and other antioxidants that benefit health.
        
        Lemons are a citrus fruit that people often use in traditional remedies because of their health benefits. Like other citrus fruits, they contain vitamin C and other antioxidants.
        
        Antioxidants are essential for human health. These compounds mop up free radicals in the body that can damage the body's cells and lead to diseases, such as cancers.
        
        Researchers believe that the flavonoids in lemon and other citrus fruits have antibacterial, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties.
        
        Citrus fruits, including lemons, contain active components called phytochemicals that benefit health. These include:
        
            vitamin C
            folic acid
            potassium
            pectin
        
        The juice from one 48 g lemon containsTrusted Source the following nutrients in grams (g) or milligrams (mg):
        
            11 calories
            3.31 g carbohydrate
            49 mg potassium
            18.6 mg vitamin C
            3 mg calcium
            0.1 g of fiber
        
        Lemons also contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin A.

        <h4>How to eat lemons</h4>
        
        Use the juice of a lemon to flavor drinking water or squeeze over a salad or fish. Try adding lemon juice to boiling water with a teaspoon of honey to help soothe a sore throat. It is also possible to eat the rind of organic lemons. Some people use the rind in recipes.
        <h4>2. Strawberries</h4>
        
        Strawberries are a juicy, red fruit with a high water content. The seeds provide plenty of dietary fiber per serving. Strawberries contain many healthful vitamins and minerals.

        The human body cannot make vitamin C itself, so people need to get this vitamin from their diet.Oranges also contain high levels of pectin, which is a fiber that can keep the colon healthy by binding to chemicals that can cause cancer and removing them from the colon.
        
        Oranges also provide the following healthful vitamins:
        
            vitamin A, a compound that is important for healthy skin and eyesight
            B-vitamins, including thiamin and folate, which help keep the nervous and reproductive systems healthy and help create red blood cells.
